# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

This is an implementation of CNN on Python 3, Keras, and TensorFlow. This repo consists of a dataset which has 30,010 images and this gets divided into two sub sets i.e. Train set and Test set.

1. [hdr.py](https://github.com/bonie09/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition/blob/master/hdr.py) - This file is a step by step process of data preprocessing, creation of model and training of model.
2. [app.py](https://github.com/bonie09/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition/blob/master/app.py) - This file is for a basic GUI and it consists predict_digit() which will detect the digit and it will give the accuracy.
3. [hdr.h5](https://github.com/bonie09/Handwritten-Digit-Recognition/blob/master/hdr.h5) - Saved model which was trained on a dataset.
